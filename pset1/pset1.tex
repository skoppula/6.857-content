\answer{1-1 - An edX Security Policy}

\textbf{Objective}: The EdX MOOC platform aims to provide educational content to users of the platform. The platform includes other auxiliary objectives such as being able to update course content, provide inter-person interactivity, and reward users for course completion.\\

\textbf{Principals and Authorized Behavior}: The platform has three main roles: student, teacher, and administrator. Each have their own set of allowed functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Student: a student must be able to request enrollment into a course, view content for an  enrolled courses (to the extent allowed by course instructor(s)), submit digitally signed answers and feedback to (enrolled) course instructor, modify their own profile information (login username, password, email), and receive certificate of completions as determined by the instructor.
\item Teacher: authorize student enrollment into their course, authorize other instructors to co-administer their course, modify course meta-data (name, description) and content, send signed feedback to student, view the submissions of student enrolled in their course(s), modify their own profile information (email, login username, password), add new course, and award certificate of completion to select student users.
\item Administrator: add teacher user accounts.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Confidentiality/Integrity Details:}: Specifically, by use of some security mechanism (perhaps, OAuth 2.0 or like), we intend that the platform forbids the student viewing or modify the content and progress of other users (except to view the content of their enrolled courses as allowed by their course instructors). The student should not be able to obtain completion certificates without proper authentication.\\

The teacher should not be able to view the submissions of students not currently in their course. They should not be able to update the content of the courses that they were not authorized to administer.

\answer{1-3 - Reused Pad Cipher}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Insecure implementation - the implementation of a theoretically secure algorithms might have vulnerabilities. For example, the OpenSSL library this year was revealed to have a buffer over-read bug, Heartbleed.
  \item Improper use -  users might misuse otherwise secure software/algorithms. For example, short/weak keys and re-using passwords could introduce vulnerabilities.
  \item Legal retrieval - the government (for example) might file court orders to obtain private keys
  \item Social engineering - adversaries could extract personal information. A great example might be email or phone call phishing, in which unsuspecting victims reveal personal information to agents posing as authorities.
  \item Hardware injection - an example is keyloggers, tracking keystrokes and potentially passwords.
  \item backdoors, bribery, coercion
\end{itemize}
